<h1>Indoor Sports</h1>
<p style="background-color: white;margin: 5px;padding: 5px">
    Everyone enjoys games because they provide entertainment as well as exercise. If we talk about Indoor games, these games refer to games that we can play under the house's roof with so many people. For example, Ludo, Carrom, Puzzle, Card games, Chess, Table tennis, and board games.
<p style="background-color: white;margin: 5px;padding: 5px">
    Play is a part of education and important for our life. If there is no play, life becomes monotonous. Our brain and body are both exercised when we play games. We may enhance our bodies and minds while learning qualities and lessons by playing indoor games. They also teach us how to be disciplined and polite. We can improve our self-esteem as well as our sense of fair play. We can learn how to follow the rules and regulations correctly.

    It was the perfect day for a party! The sun was shining and the breeze was blowing. Guests started arriving and soon the party was in full swing. But there was a problem â€“ the adults and children were getting bored of just talking to each other. What could they do?

Suddenly, it hit me! We could play games! Outdoor games, that is. I quickly gathered some games for each group and everyone had a blast playing them.

    The adults enjoyed playing Kan Jam and Croquet, while the children loved running around playing tag and Simon Says. It was great to see everyone having fun and enjoying themselves.
