## Introduction to Web Development

**Web Development** is the process of creating websites and web applications for the internet. It involves:

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the web.
- **CSS**: The style and layout of the web.
- **JavaScript**: The interactivity and dynamic behavior of the web.

This repository documents my progress as I master these technologies, laying the foundation for creating modern, responsive, and interactive web applications.
Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
